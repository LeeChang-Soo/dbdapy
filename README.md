This repo contains the solutions to the exercises of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, 2nd Edition, by J. L. Kruschke.
I've started by following the book and the exercises as is, but somewhere around chapter 5 I've changed my mind and decided to code my solutions in python and [pymc3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3). More info why is [here](http://tomgurion.blogspot.co.il/2015/05/writing-programming-book-dont-compose.html).

The following are also great resources for this book solutions, in python:

- [erikson84's BayesDataAnalysisWithPyMC](https://github.com/erikson84/BayesDataAnalysisWithPyMC)
- [aloctavodia's Doing_bayesian_data_analysis](https://github.com/aloctavodia/Doing_bayesian_data_analysis)

## Why am I doing this?

I think that my approach deserve its own repo because

- I'm not translating the R code into python and rather provide solution to the exercises using the best tools I can find.
- It's all in ipython notebook format, with figures and stuff, for better learning experience.

Note that this repo will probably remains a work in progress for a long time. But you are welcome to help.

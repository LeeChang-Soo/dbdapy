This repo contains the solutions to the exercises of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, 2nd Edition, by J. L. Kruschke.
It will probably remains a work in progress for a long time.

## Getting the book utility scripts

    wget https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/software-installation/DBDA2Eprograms.zip
    unzip DBDA2Eprograms.zip
    rm DBDA2Eprograms.zip

The `utils` directory contains my "improvements" to the author utilities that came with the book,
mainly by loosing some of the unnecessary dependencies between scripts.
